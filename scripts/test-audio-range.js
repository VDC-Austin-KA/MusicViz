/* Self-check for the band normaliser in js/audio.js —
 * `node scripts/test-audio-range.js`.
 *
 * The bug this guards against: dividing by a running peak that has already been
 * raised by the current sample. Every new maximum then reports exactly 1.0, so
 * on a compressed master the meters sit crushed against full scale and the
 * visualizer stops reacting. Measured on the compressed case below, that
 * implementation gave mean 0.93 / min 0.78 / spread 0.22 — the whole signal
 * squeezed into the top fifth of the scale.
 *
 * Note the assertions are about mean and spread, not about how often the value
 * touches 1.0: a signal that genuinely spends time at its own maximum *should*
 * peg there, and both implementations do.
